The lessons can be chosen as single, group or a combination of both. Additionally, we offer English courses in Ireland for schoolchildren (with or without accompanying parents), which take place during school holidays. Central to the learning concept, and indeed to the various activities, is fun. We also prepare the pupils for their school tests. The past has shown excellent results, probably because we show the kids that English can be fun and inhibitions in speaking are quickly forgotten. So if your children are having problems with English in school, then rather than investing in tuition, invest in an intensive course in the (soon-to-be) only English speaking country in the EU.
