                Backstory
              </h2>
              <p class="text-black pb-2">
                Born and raised in Italy, I moved to Bavaria as soon as I could because honestly who wants gorgeous weather and delicious food everyday?
              </p>
              <p class="text-black pb-2">Since then I shortly lived in the UK, because the Bavarian weather became doch too good, and also managed to get an Italian masters degree.</p>
              <p class="text-black pb-2">I can teach you how to talk business in Milan, and what to say after you had the best wine of your life in Tuscany (even if you're french). I can't help you with the southern dialect though. There, we would both be in the Lord's hands.</p>
              <p class="text-black pb-2">Also, my favourite word is, and will always be, Illinois.</p>
