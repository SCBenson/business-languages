              <h2 class="text-custom-purple">A Non-Traditional Path</h2>
              <p>
                I won’t pretend I grew up wanting to be a Business English
                trainer. My journey took some unexpected turns, including stints
                as a shepherd, actor, roadie, salesman, and even (briefly!) a
                professional baseball player. It wasn't until 1999 that I found
                my true calling: helping others communicate effectively in the
                business world.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-custom-purple">Grounded Leadership</h2>
              <p>
                My name may translate from Gaelic as "Ruler of the World, Son of
                Kings," but I believe in keeping my feet firmly on the ground.
                That's reflected in the team I've built at Business Languages
                Anywhere.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-custom-purple">The Team Philosophy</h2>
              <p>
                I've gathered a pool of talented individuals who are passionate
                about their field and dedicated to sharing their expertise. My
                leadership is inspired by the former French (and Manchester
                United) footballer Eric Cantona.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-custom-purple">The Cantona Lesson</h2>
              <p>
                I once saw an interviewer ask Cantona what he considered his
                greatest action on the pitch. He didn't pick one of his
                countless goals, but rather a blind pass to a colleague (Denis
                Irwin) who scored. Cantona explained, "You must trust your
                teammates." And I do.

                Building Business Languages Anywhere
              </h2>
              <p>
                After training as a Business English instructor in 1999, I
                gained experience with various schools. I founded Business
                Languages Augsburg (now Business Languages Anywhere!) in October
                2004. Three of the trainers who started with me are still with
                me today – a testament to our shared vision.
              </p>

                Blending Experience and Innovation
              </h2>
              <p>
                Our success lies in our ability to adapt and thrive. We've
                weathered recessions, pandemics, and financial crises while
                consistently providing training at the top level. We've kept up
                with the times and ahead of the posse!
