                From Music Teacher to Linguistics Instructor
              </h2>
              <p class="text-black">
                Hey, my name is Alex. I study English linguistics at Uni
                Augsburg and work part-time as a teacher. My first experiences
                as a teacher weren't actually related to English, but rather
                music and instruments.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-custom-purple">Beyond the Credentials</h2>
              <p class="text-black">
                In my introduction I could have written what my competences and
                references are, but this standard way of introduction does not
                suit my philosophy, which I also teach with.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-custom-purple">Personalized Learning</h2>
              <p class="text-black">
                For me, it’s all about the individual and their needs: What kind
                of values you have, what goals and expectations, dreams in life,
                etc. By getting to know each other a little better on a personal
                level, we can also learn together and achieve more.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-custom-purple">Inspired by Great Teachers</h2>
              <p class="text-black">
                I always look back to my teachers in music or at school, how
                they shaped and influenced me, and I want to continue on their
                path.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-custom-purple">Musical Pursuits</h2>
              <p class="text-black">
                But enough philosophy, let’s finish with a few personal details
                about me. I love writing, producing, and playing music, either
                alone or with a band. Back in school, I used to teach some
                friends of mine drums and guitar, but never thought that I would
                want to teach professionally. But here I am, and I love it! I
                play piano, drums, guitar, bass, and since the pandemic I’ve
                also started recording music.
              </p>
              <h2 class="text-custom-purple">Interests and Passions</h2>
              <p class="text-black pb-2">
                My idols in music are Kevin Parker, Stu Mackenzie, and Paul
                McCartney. I’m a football fan, my favourite teams are Bayern
                Munich (because of my family) and Tottenham, which might seem
                random, but I’ve been a supporter since I was 11 years old. I
                also enjoy film, especially the “old classics”: Kubrick,
                Tarantino, and Fincher are my favourite directors.
