                "I’m Divya, from London. I’ve been at BLA from the start. What
                keeps me on this merry ship after so many years? Of course, the
                great team spirit…but also my passion for effective
                communication. Once you have that, all else follows. Anyone who
                jumps on board with us is in for a fun and interesting learning
                experience. We know all too well the tricky waters of our fine
                language and can help you navigate through, so that when we
                finally reach the harbour together, you feel confident in all
                your English interactions. Hop aboard!"
