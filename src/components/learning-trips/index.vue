                Our English trainers will equip you with perfect English skills
                so that you achieve competence and security in both written and
                spoken English. The lessons can be chosen as single, group or a
                combination of both. Additionally, we offer English courses in
                Ireland for schoolchildren (with or without accompanying
                parents), which take place during school holidays. Central to
                the learning concept, and indeed to the various activities, is
                fun. We also prepare the pupils for their school tests. The past
                has shown excellent results, probably because we show the kids
                that English can be fun and inhibitions in speaking are quickly
                forgotten. So if your children are having problems with English
                in school, then rather than investing in tuition, invest in an
                intensive course in the (soon-to-be) only English speaking
                country in the EU. A language is most easily learned in a
                country where it is spoken.
