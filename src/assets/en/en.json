Lots of money was invested and the concept was brilliant. What happened? Our customers didn’t want it. Fast forward to March 2020. Suddenly everyone wanted and indeed needed online training. After ignoring the concept for the years in-between, we were faced with adapting or going under. And we adapted and can now offer cutting edge training online."

The trainer will offer time slots and make recommendations as to how frequent the training should be. Homework can be sent electronically if deemed beneficial, classes can be recorded for later review, new vocabulary is imparted using chat functions. But as with all of our classes the emphasis will be on communication. We look at cultural aspects like when to use Sie or Du. We offer advice on everyday tasks like opening bank accounts and shopping. But most importantly we will act as a sounding board and practice partner for your business exchanges."

We will set up the groups in consultation with participants, superiors and personnel departments, after a grading interview online or by phone. Active participation will be encouraged at all times. Practical exercises will be offered. And we won’t bullshit you. You will learn the basics, polite phrases, numbers, reading signs, booking into hotels, welcoming guests etc. But proficiency in Mandarin will require total immersion, so do keep that in mind."

Central to the learning concept, and indeed to the various activities, is fun. We also prepare the pupils for their school tests. The past has shown excellent results, probably because we show the kids that English can be fun and inhibitions in speaking are quickly forgotten. So if your children are having problems with English in school, then rather than investing in tuition, invest in an intensive course in the (soon-to-be) only English speaking country in the EU.",
